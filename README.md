## 📋 Overview

**Resume AI Analyzer & Job Recommend System** parses a candidate's resume (PDF or DOCX), extracts skills and structure, and scores it against **live job postings** pulled in real time from Adzuna and Jooble. Instead of comparing your resume to a static, hand-picked list of "sample jobs," every match is against a role that's actually hiring right now.

Under the hood, matching is powered by **TF-IDF vectorization + cosine similarity** (the same core technique real ATS platforms use) rather than a hardcoded keyword whitelist — so it adapts to whatever domain the resume and job description are actually in.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Resume Analysis
- Drag-and-drop upload — **PDF & DOCX** supported
- ATS readability score (0–100), weighted from section-completeness + keyword match
- Section detection — contact, skills, experience, education, projects
- Matched vs. missing keywords, per job
- Dynamic keyword extraction (TF-IDF-ranked, not a fixed whitelist)

### 💼 Live Job Matching
- Real-time postings from **Adzuna** and **Jooble**, fetched in parallel and de-duplicated
- Cosine-similarity match score per job, batch-computed for speed
- Location-aware search

### 📊 Dashboard & History
- Total analyses, average ATS score, saved jobs, resumes uploaded — at a glance
- ATS score trend chart over time
- Full resume history with per-job breakdown, delete, and printable report

### ⭐ Saved Jobs
- Bookmark roles to apply to later
- Search your saved list
- One click to the original posting

### 👤 Profile
- Editable headline, avatar, GitHub/LinkedIn/portfolio links

### 🎨 Interface
- Light/dark mode with persistence
- Responsive layout
- Toast notifications, animated stat cards, empty states throughout

### 🔐 Accounts
- Secure signup/login (hashed passwords, Flask-Login sessions)
- Per-user data isolation — every query is scoped to the logged-in user
